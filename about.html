				<p class="owner-copy">I began my journey in the graphic arts in 1995 after graduating from George Washington University studying Graphic Communications and Publishing. It’s been an amazing journey working for commercial printers, marketing/communications firms, advertising agencies, dot coms & publishing companies in Los Angeles and Chicago. I’ve worked on a wide array of projects including product catalogs, CD designs, product packaging, print advertising, high-end photo retouching and web design.

				<p class="owner-copy">Solving graphic communication challenges is a passion. I look forward to helping you solve yours.</p>

				<p class="owner-copy">For me, Brash Puppy Creative is the culmination of a passionate pursuit for creative fulfillment. I discovered my passion for art and design early in life. After graduating high school, I continued my education at Northwest University in Kirkland Washington, where I obtained a B.A. in Communications with an emphasis in Film Studies. While enrolled at NU, I led the campus media group and assisted the marketing department with promotional videos, graphics, and collateral.  I later attended LAFSC in Hollywood, CA where I studied the principles of film, editing, and composition.  The skills I attained at LAFSC lend themselves well to the design process and provide me a broad skill set. Shortly after graduation I started my own marketing company, where I dedicated my time to logo development, corporate branding, product labels, marketing campaigns, and web development.</p>
				<p class="owner-copy">I love people. I love to create. I look forward to working with you.</p>
