Created the Brashpuppy Creative site for me and my friend Matt to help promote ourselves for freelance, side projects. Site was built with a combination of Bootstrap and hand coding. Design of the site was kept clean and "flat". We wanted the site to be colorful and almost playful. The site is responsive. The deployed site can be viewed at http://www.brashpuppy.com
